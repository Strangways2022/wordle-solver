# wordle-solver
A Wordle or Absurdle game solver.

The word list is used to validate words and possible future guesses.  A second word list could be used for possible words, but the list would have to be accurate if Wordle change their word list.  

The Solver can be used for Aburdle with the current word list.

Possible future adjustments to the code:
a. only show the Wordle board as guesses are made for better screen fitting.
